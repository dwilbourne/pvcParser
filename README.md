# pvcParser

Parsers take a data as an argument and turn that data into something with semantics. They can be as simple as turning a
value like '4' into the number 4 (which turns out not to be so simple once you introduce internationalization and
localization!). More somplicated structures can include parsing DOM documents or php files.
